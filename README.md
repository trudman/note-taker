# 11 Express.js: Note Taker

## Description

This project was my note taker app using Express.js and deploying to Heroku. This was a challenging assignement as it was my first time using Express.js to work with databases. It was very helpful to get more accustomed to GET and POST requests in addition to routing. This project also allowed me to deploy my first application to Heroku. The Delete request was very challenging with the syntax but am fortunate that I was able to work through the logic and make it function properly. Overall, I am very satisfied with how the project turned out.

# Installation

The deployed app is available on Heroku via the link below.

# Usage

To use the note taker application the user can navigate to the Heroku page and enter note titles and text to save to their list. Once saved they are able to add additional notes or delete previously written notes.
